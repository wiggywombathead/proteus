\begin{abstract}
    This project presents an educational operating system for the Raspberry Pi 1
    Model B+, written for the purpose of demystifying aspects of operating
    systems development for the hobbyist programmer, especially with regards to
    low-level systems programming and core features to a computer's execution.
    It provides a small multiprocessing kernel developed with the aim of clarity
    of understanding and ease of extension. Together with a simple interface to
    further configure the system at compile-time, it aims to promote a practical
    approach to operating systems education. This interface can be easily
    extended to accommodate different models of inter-process communication.
    Future work should be aimed at increasing the operating system's usability
    in a real-world context, in particular with regard to user input and access
    to permanent storage, of which it has none. While it is limited in this
    sense, it provides a simple and open testbed on which to both study how key
    operating system concepts are implemented in practice, as well as invite the
    addition of new features.
