\section{Implementation}
    The following section largely documents the system as it was developed
    chronologically, and is not representative of the order in which systems are
    initialised in the final piece of software. This better highlights the
    dependencies between each discrete stage in development and reinforces the
    plan-driven approach to the project as a whole.

\subsection{System initialisation}
    There are two main files which handle the entirety of system startup, namely
    \code{linker.ld} and \code{boot.S}, the former responsible for defining the
    layout of the final executable we will be producing, and the latter handling
    the setup of the C runtime environment and passing control to the main
    kernel function.

    \subsubsection{Linker Script}
        \label{sec:Linker}
        In order to create a kernel, or any program for that matter, we must
        link all compiled object files into a single executable. For user-space
        programs, that is, programs written to run in an established operating
        system, there are default scripts provided by the compiler which do
        this. Since the operating system on which we will run the kernel does
        not yet exist, we must create a linker script ourselves.

        We begin by declaring that the symbol \code{\_start} is the entry point
        for our entire program (this is usually \code{main} for user-space
        programs), meaning execution will jump to this address when the system
        starts. We first declare the symbols \code{\_\_start} and
        \code{\_\_text\_start} at address \code{0x8000}, which informs the
        bootloader where to place our kernel image. Addresses up to
        \code{0x8000} will be reserved for the stack. After this we must declare
        one by one each of the major sections which will be used in the ELF
        file, the first of which is the \code{.text} section, containing
        executable code.  The code from \code{boot.S} is placed in the
        \code{.text.boot} section, and we use the \code{KEEP} directive to
        inform the linker not to optimise the code in that section -- we want it
        running exactly what is written there. We declare the sections
        \code{.rodata}, \code{.data}, and \code{.bss} similarly, each time
        declaring global symbols for them should the need to use them as
        variables arise (as is the case, for example, when placing the metadata
        for pages directly after the kernel image, see Section \ref{sec:pages}).
        We also use the directive \code{ALIGN} to define a page size for the
        kernel image -- specifically, this sets the current address to the next
        available address that is divisible by the page size we set, 4096 bytes.

    \subsubsection{Initialising the C runtime}
        With our kernel image sections defined, we can actually write the code
        that will boot into our kernel, contained in the file \code{boot.S}. We
        begin by declaring that this is to be placed in the \code{.text.boot}
        section (as used by the bootloader) and we make our start symbol visible
        from any file using the \code{.global} directive -- this is required for
        the linker to see which location to jump to at system startup.

        The project was initially written for the Raspberry Pi 2, containing the
        quad-core Cortex-A7 CPU. However, since multicore programming entails
        extra difficulty even in a familiar user-space environment, it was
        always designed to only use one of these cores. The following code
        remains included in the project, wrapped in a test to determine which
        processor we have compiled for, and sends three of the four cores to
        hang. We will discuss it now to introduce the idea of the ARM
        coprocessor:

        \lstset{style=asm}
        \begin{lstlisting}
_start:
    mrc p15, #0, r1, c0, c0, #5
    and r1, r1, #3
    cmp r1, #0
    bne halt
        \end{lstlisting}

        The `mrc` and `mcr` instructions allows for interaction with the system
        control processor, and denote ``move data from coprocessor to ARM
        register'' and ``move data from ARM register to coprocessor''
        respectively. The purpose of this is to control and provide status
        information for the functions implemented on the ARM1176JZF-S processor
        \cite[p.~3-2]{TRM}, and exposes optional\footnote{ARM only provides
        specifications for processors; it is down to hardware manufacturers to
        implement their designs.} additional functionality that is not provided
        by the core instruction set. Among others, these functions include:
        \begin{itemize}
            \itemsep0em
            \item System control and configuration
            \item MMU control and configuration
            \item Cache control and configuration
            \item Direct Memory Access (DMA) control
            \item System performance monitoring
        \end{itemize}

        As it stands, the project only makes use of the first two. The code
        block itself reads the Multiprocessor Affinity Register \cite{MPIDR} for
        the identifier of the current CPU it is testing, and if neither of the
        two lower bits returned are 1, then the core is sent to halt
        indefinitely in a low-power state.

        With just a single core to develop for, the next step is to set up the
        stack pointer at address \code{0x8000}. The program counter for the
        kernel starts at address \code{0x8000} and grows upwards, and, since the
        stack grows downwards, it is safe to place it at this address without it
        interfering with the kernel. Next the start and end of the Basic Service
        Set (BSS) is loaded into registers -- recall that this is where
        statically allocated global variables are stored. Since the C standard
        requires uninitialised global variables to be zeroed, we must zero out
        (that is, store the value 0) in the registers between the addresses of
        \code{\_\_bss\_start} and \code{\_\_bss\_end}.

        The final responsibility of \code{boot.S} is to transfer control to our
        kernel entry point, \code{kernel\_main}, by loading the address of this
        symbol into the program counter. Overall, this small portion of the
        codebase initialises a minimum C environment, meaning the stack is
        initialised and the BSS segment zeroed before we pass control to our
        custom kernel. Note that the use of registers 0, 1, and 2 is avoided as
        the bootloader uses these to pass system parameters and hardware
        information to the main function\footnote{Namely, the device from which
        the system was booted, the ARM Linux Machine Type (\code{0xc42} for the
        Pi), and the address of the atags, containing more important information
        such as available memory.} at runtime.

\subsection{Organising memory}
    \subsubsection{Atags}
        One important piece of data passed by the bootloader to the main kernel
        function is the address of the ``atags'' -- this is a list of tags which
        describe various system parameters such as total system memory, the
        initial ramdisk, and command-line parameters to pass, and is passed
        through address \code{0x100} on the Raspberry Pi 1. Throughout the
        execution of the operating system, computations will require memory and
        since the project functions entirely in kernel-space, any and all memory
        is available to use. To impose some structure on the memory and manage
        it effectively, however, we organise it into 4kiB pages, allowing for
        equal-sized blocks of memory, which are neither insignificantly nor
        prohibitively large, to be allocated and tracked. Therefore, most
        important piece of information among the atags is the total system
        memory, which the project uses in its implementation of a dynamic memory
        allocator.

        In order to parse this list of tags, we need the kernel to understand
        the layout of the data it is being passed. In particular, each tag
        consists of two values: an unsigned 32-bit integer denoting the length
        of the tag (in 32-bit words), and the tag itself, details of which are
        found at \cite{atags}. This provides information concerning the memory
        tag itself, namely that it contains two unsigned 32-bit integers
        describing memory size and start address, in this order. Therefore, we
        define the C structure \code{atag\_mem} to easily access these two
        fields once we come across the memory tag. Thus, to determine the total
        memory available we iterate over the atags list until we find the memory
        tag, cast this to our \code{atag\_mem} structure, and return the field
        denoting the size of system memory.

    \subsubsection{Pages}
        \label{sec:pages}
        The total number of pages is the total size of memory divided by the
        page size, which we have set to 4kiB. In order to effectively manage
        each page, we create a list containing metadata for each page: this
        metadata includes, for example, the virtual address to which it maps,
        along with bit-field flags detailing whether the page is allocated, if
        it available for sharing, if it is a kernel page (for when user-space is
        implemented), and whether it is a regular page or a page on the heap.
        We use the global symbol \code{\_\_end}, declared in the linker script,
        to place the page metadata list directly after the end of the kernel
        image.

        To allocate a page, we need of knowledge of which ones are free to do
        so, for which we create a linked list of all such pages. Then all that
        is needed is to return a pointer to its location in memory, modify the
        appropriate flags in the page array, and remove it from our free pages
        list.
