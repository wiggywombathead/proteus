\section{Implementation}
\subsection{Booting}
    There are two main files which handle the entirety of system startup, namely
    \code{linker.ld} and \code{boot.S}, the former responsible for defining the
    layout of the final executable we will be producing, and the latter handling
    the setup of the C runtime environment and passing control to the main
    kernel function.

    \subsubsection{Linker Script}
        \label{sec:Linker}
        In order to create a kernel, or any program for that matter, we must
        link all compiled object files into a single executable. For user-space
        programs, that is, programs written to run in an established operating
        system, there are default scripts provided by the compiler which do
        this. Since the operating system on which we will run the kernel does
        not yet exist, we must create a linker script ourselves.

        We begin by declaring that the symbol \code{\_start} is the entry point
        for our entire program (this is usually \code{main} for user-space
        programs), meaning execution will jump to this address when the system
        starts. We first declare the symbols \code{\_\_start} and
        \code{\_\_text\_start} at address \code{0x8000}, which informs the
        bootloader where to place our kernel image. Addresses up to
        \code{0x8000} will be reserved for the stack. After this we must declare
        one by one each of the major sections which will be used in the ELF
        file, the first of which is the \code{.text} section, containing
        executable code.  The code from \code{boot.S} is placed in the
        \code{.text.boot} section, and we use the \code{KEEP} directive to
        inform the linker not to optimise the code in that section -- we want it
        running exactly what is written there. We declare the sections
        \code{.rodata}, \code{.data}, and \code{.bss} similarly, each time
        declaring global symbols for them should the need to use them as
        variables arise (as is the case, for example, when placing the metadata
        for pages directly after the kernel image, see Section \ref{sec:pages}).
