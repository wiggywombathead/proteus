\section{Introduction}
    Operating systems are some of the most pervasive pieces of software around,
    but due to their inherent complexity, their inner workings are often
    impenetrable to understand without specialist knowledge. While widespread
    access to a personal computer is nothing new, the introduction of the
    Raspberry Pi in recent years has rendered experimentation with computers
    much more affordable and hence readily available, inviting tinkering at all
    levels with less concern of economic loss. The Pi therefore provides an
    ideal platform for operating systems education -- novice developers looking
    to get involved in writing such systems have access to a standardised set of
    hardware that is inexpensive both to maintain and replace, if and when
    things go wrong. Now seven years since its initial release, the Raspberry
    Pi has several official operating systems to offer, each addressing its own
    issue such as ease-of-installation, Internet of Things integration, or
    classroom management \cite{OSes}, with many more unofficial ones. However,
    there is less in the way of those written to teach concepts of the operating
    system itself -- this project attempts to fill this gap by providing a
    configurable, educational operating system for the Raspberry Pi 1 Model B+.
    The focus is on presenting code which is simple to understand and providing
    clear interfaces that encourage ease of extensibility, and hence a
    practical, software-driven approach to learning about operating systems.

\subsection{Motivation}
    An operating system draws together aspects from all over the field of
    computer science, whose development requires intimate knowledge of low-level
    concepts such as the computer's organisation and architecture, up to an
    understanding of the more abstract in designing how processes communicate
    or implementing filesystems. The opportunity to write one as part of this
    project was therefore appealing as it served not only to provide the author
    with experience in an area of computer science of great interest,
    but also the chance to unite and put into practice many of the topics
    learned throughout the undergraduate computer science course. One of the key
    motivations of this project was therefore to gain experience in low-level
    systems programming and interacting with real-world hardware, all the while
    creating a useful and entirely self-contained piece of software.

    The main goal of this project is to provide an operating system for the
    Raspberry Pi that is capable of booting on real hardware, for both
    educational and hobbyist use. An important aspect of this is gaining
    practical experience in this unique area of software development, and so in
    addition to being configurable at compile-time, offering multiple approaches
    to process scheduling and inter-process communication, it also aims to be
    easily-understandable and open to extension. In order to achieve this it
    must also implement a basic interface to manage this compile-time
    configuration. Also key to the project's success is the ability to boot on
    real hardware - while it would largely be possible to implement in a solely
    emulated environment with the help of a virtual machine, this project
    attempts to provide the additional valuable experience of taking real-world
    design considerations and observing their effects on live hardware, the
    latter of which is easily ignored if working only through an emulator.
