\section{Evaluation}
    \label{sec:evaluation}
    Overall the project has been a success, not only in terms of the goals set
    out in the specification and progress report, but as an educational
    process and as a first experience in systems programming. The project has
    achieved what it was initially designed to do in providing an operating
    system that was capable of functioning on real-world hardware, and
    furthermore implements key features such as memory management, exception
    handling, and multiprocessing. Although this list seems initially
    underwhelming, a much greater appreciation was gained for the significant
    level of work required to make these systems work -- while, effectively, all
    the operating system does is print two sequences of letters in order
    (testing synchronisation), then print Fibonacci numbers at the same time as
    flashing its LED (testing multiprocessing), in all the lines of code total
    roughly 3,000. Furthermore, there is more work that has gone into it
    ``behind-the-scenes'', such as reading through the pages of technical
    documentation for details about addresses, offsets, and registers. This is
    to say that the project has been an enjoyable window into the previously
    unknown and quite unique low-level systems programming, and greatly
    increased the author's appreciation of such a discipline. Furthermore, the
    project has been a good challenge; it is true that the documentation for
    some of the mechanisms on the Pi, especially with regards to the BCM2835
    chip, is sometimes lacking, despite the existence of the technical reference
    manuals. The sense of satisfaction for finally making a piece of code work
    correctly, however, is all the more rewarding because of it.

    The initial goal was to create a modular kernel for the Raspberry Pi --
    since the project still does not implement all the functionality it set out
    to in the specification, it was (in hindsight) a good decision to switch
    focus to its educational value, as building an interface for dynamic module
    loading and linking would have entailed much more complexity. The
    compile-time configuration options do, however, simulate this modularity to
    an extent, albeit if more cumbersome. The project therefore does have value
    as a hobbyist operating system, to an extent, and the foundations have been
    laid for this to increase with further work.

\subsection{Achievements}
    As mentioned, one of the key achievements of the project is the delivering
    of an operating system that functions on real hardware, along with the
    features that it implements, most rewarding of which has been seeing the
    success of multiprocessing and process scheduling. More implicit
    achievements have come in the form of skills such as project management and
    software engineering skills. Being the largest individual project undertaken
    since starting university, it has required that much more organisation and
    planning, especially regarding processes such as timetabling, detailing the
    project specification, and carefully designing each component of the
    software. Furthermore, competency in both the C programming language and the
    ARM assembly instruction set has greatly increased, and in particular using
    them both in conjunction -- future projects can now focus on applying the
    competencies learned, without the need to learn them first (as has been the
    case on this project). Confidence was also gained in the build process in
    general and the management of a relatively large codebase. Carefully
    defining Makefile targets to accelerate the build process has been useful,
    and indeed the project would have been impossible without a working
    knowledge of this. Useful features such as conditional compilation have
    also been explored. Finally, the requirement of proficiency with digesting
    technical documentation has been an achievement of the project, and the deep
    working knowledge that this builds of the platform has been a rewarding one
    to see grow.
    
\subsection{Limitations}
    The project is not without its limitations, chief of which has been the
    number of systems initially desired to have implemented. In particular, the
    specification and progress reports both outline features such as filesystems
    and a command prompt to have been implemented, when in reality these are
    still far from being written -- the process lacks any user interaction at
    all. Although this oversight is not a failure, to a certain extent forgiven
    by the lack of prior experience in such software development, it is still
    the most significant limitation of the project, and care must be taken in
    the future to avoid this case of underestimation.  Furthermore, it would
    have been desirable to implement several other process schedulers; while
    this was judged to be non-urgent in lieu of other more pressing features,
    using the compile-time configuration to its full extent would have been
    satisfying. On a more technical note, while the implementation of the First
    Come First Served scheduler is functional and correctly schedules processes,
    it does so ungracefully -- specifically, the interface using the \code{void
    (*schedule)(void)} must be slightly redesigned, as at present it still
    triggers a system timer interrupt every quantum. The FCFS scheduler simply
    ignores this, so while it works, it is perhaps not ideal. Finally, a further
    limitation regarding the project management of the project has been the lack
    of user-acceptance testing -- this would certainly have helped in adjusting
    the interfaces to be more user-friendly, and while they are intuitive to the
    author they may not be so to someone who has not spent as much time
    entrenched in its development. These features were, however, implemented
    late in the project's lifetime, meaning there was simply little time to do
    such testing and have it make a meaningful difference. It instead should
    have been allotted for earlier on in the planning phase of the project, and
    was an oversight.
    
\subsection{Further work}
    The lack of user-interaction at present is perhaps the most pressing of
    features to implement, especially now that the project presents an
    environment that would warrant such a feature. In particular, this entails
    writing a working interface with the USB controller on the Pi and using this
    to interact with an interrupt-driven keyboard driver -- only then would a
    shell be a useful feature. Furthermore, shared memory must be refined and
    make use of greater memory protection, little more than a text buffer
    currently. Finally, an interface for the EMMC should be implemented in order
    to provide permanent storage options, by interacting with the SD and some
    implementation of a filesystem.
