% good - learnt loads
% shift from modularity to educational
% good compile-time configuration (like modularity ish), and truly modular much
% harder
% difficulty adhering to schedule - underestimation of workload
% not entirely correct in how scheduler chosen - timer still generates
% interrupts, just ignored
% could have used user acceptance testing - just not enough time!
