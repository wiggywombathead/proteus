## Todo
### Write-up
- [ ] Introduction
- [ ] Background
  - [x] Motivation
  - [x] Relevant material
  - [x] Why useful
- [ ] Design
  - [x] Hardware/architecture overview
    - [ ] Finish off useful concepts section
    - [ ] Have section labeled sec:GPIO and sec:LinkerSection
  - [ ] Project Management
- [ ] Implementation
    - [ ] Boot
    - [ ] Memory management
    - [ ] Framebuffer
    - [ ] Processes
    - [ ] Synchronisation
    - [ ] Keyboard
- [ ] Testing
- [ ] Results
- [ ] Conclusions
  - [ ] Evaluation
  - [ ] Further work

### Functional
- [x] Enable MMU
  - [ ] Not working for `0x00100000`???
- [ ] Get `try_lock()` (i.e. mutexes) working with `ldrex/strex`
- [ ] Processes
  - [x] Round Robin
  - [x] Make `schedule()` take algorithm as parameter
    - `schedulerfn` is a function pointer which may change
  - [x] Write up notes on creating new process
  - [ ] Option to create thread with arguments
- [ ] Filesystem
- [ ] IPC
- [x] Interrupts
  - [x] Finish `vector_table.S`
  - [x] Write up notes
- [x] Boot on real pi
- [x] Look through Baking Pi code and translate to C
  - unnecessary
- [x] Display to real HDMI
- [x] Debug rainbow screen at boot

### Polish
- [ ] doxygen documentation for structs
- [ ] Font color must be backwards(???) - fix
- [x] Write more generalised Makefile
- [x] Change `act_blink()` to use system timer
