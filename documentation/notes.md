# OS notes

## Hardware
**Raspberry Pi 2 Model B** - uses Broadcom 2836 chip; its architecture is
identical to BCM2835 chip, except the ARM1176JZF-S processor is replaced with
the ARM Cortex-A7 processor

## Development environment
Developed on x86\_64 Linux 4.16.13-2-ARCH onwards. As the target environment is
a Raspberry Pi, which uses an ARM processor, there is the need to set up
cross-compiler to target this architecture. In particular, GCC provides
cross-compiler for arm-none-eabi, which provides a toolchain to target System V
ABI.

#### Note about System V ABI
System V ABI (Application Binary Interface) is a set of specifications that
detail calling conventions, object file formats, executable file formats,
dynamic linking semantics, and more for systems complying with the System V
Interface Definition. For example, it defines the Executable and Linkable Format
(ELF), a format for storing programs or fragments of programs on disk, created
as a result of compiling and linking. It is divided into sections, in particular
a `.text`, `.data`, `.rodata`, and `.bss` section (all discussed later), along
with `.comment`, `.note`, `.stab`, and `.stabstr` sections for compiler/linker
toolchain comments and debugging information. The calling convention details for
the Raspberry Pi 2's 32-bit Cortex A7 processor are as follows:

* 15 general purpose data storage (r0-r14)
* r15 - Program Counter
* r14 - Link Register
* r13 - Stack Pointer
* r12 - Intra-Procedure-Call Scratch Register
* r4 to r11 - used to hold local variables
* r0 to r3 - used to hold arguments passed to functions, and the returned result
* CPSR - Current Program Status Register
* SPSR - Saved Program Status Register

Subroutines must preserve the contents of r4 to r11 and the stack pointer. In
particular, subroutines that call other subroutines *must* save the return
address in the link register r14 to the stack before calling those other
subroutines. However, such subroutines do not need to return that value to
r14â€”they merely need to load that value into r15, the program counter, to
return.

It asserts a full descending stack:
* full: SP points to topmost item in stack, i.e. the location of the last item
  pushed (as opposed to empty: pointing to the next free location, the address
  where the next item will be stored)
* descending: stack grows downwards, i.e. the SP starts from a high memory
  address and progresses to lower memory addresses as items are pushed.

## First steps: minimal kernel 
### boot.s
```assembly
.section ".text.boot"
.global _start
```
This tells where the code is located in the compiled binary and makes `_start`
global i.e. visible outside of the file

```assembly
_start:
    mrc p15, #0, r1, c0, c0, #5
    and r1, r1, #3
    cmp r1, #0
    bne halt

    ...

halt:
    wfe
    b halt
```
`and Rn, Rm, <val>` - translates to Rn := Rm AND \<val\> \
Then compare if r1 == 0. \
This sends three of the four processors on board the chip to `halt`, where the
processor is put into a low-power state while it waits for an event. Multi-core
OS programming is presumably harder.

#### Note about the `mrc` instruction
Purpose is to transfer coprocessor-generated condition code flag values to the
ARM processor. In particular, `mrc p15, #0, <Rd>, c0, c0, #5` reads the MPIDR
(Multiprocessor Affinity Register), and stores it in register `Rd`.
The general syntax is `mrc pXX, op1, Rd, CRn, CRm {, op2}`, which executes some
7-bit opcode `op1` on register `pXX`, using coprocessor registers `CRn` and
`CRm` to pass operands, with an optional 7-bit opcode `op2`, and stores the
result in `Rd`. The exact code is coprocessor specific, and in this case was
found in the Cortex-A7 MPCore Technical Reference Manual.

Coprocessor in ARM is a misleading notion. It's shorthand for an optional piece
of functionality that is not exposed via the core instruction set. ARM CPUs are
modular. There are bits and pieces of CPU hardware that implementers of the
architecture may or may not place on the chip. The memory management unit (MMU)
is one example; there are others, such as the hardware debugging facility. Those
are, indeed, identified by coprocessor number (pXX), so that more than one
coprocessor can be present at the same time. The coprocessor number for MMU is
traditionally p15. Coprocessors p0..p14 have nothing to do with memory
management and may not be present. The debugging subsystem, for example, is p14.

```assembly
mov sp, #0x8000
```
Setup stack pointer (r13). Program Counter (r15) for kernel starts at 0x8000 an
grows upwards. Therefore our stack can safely start at 0x8000 without
interfering with the kernel. Note that the stack grows downwards.

```assembly
ldr r4, =__bss_start
ldr r9, =__bss_end
```
Loads start and end of BSS (Basic Service Set) into registers. This is where
statically allocated global variables that are not initialized explicitly to a
particular valuea are stored. The C runtime environment requires uninitialized
global variables to be zeroed, done by moving the value 0 to registers 5 to 8.

```assembly
b 2f

1:
    stmia r4!, {r5-r8}

2:
    cmp r4, r9 blo 1b
```
Check that address stored at r4 is less than r9. If so, the `N` flag is set and
so the line `blo 1b` is executed. This uses Local Labels to search **b**ackwards
for label 1 (previously we branched to label 2 by looking **f**orwards). The
`stm` instruction (**ST**ore **M**ultiple) stores the list of registers (the
four zeroed registers 5 to 8 inclusive) into the address of register 4. The `ia`
suffix, for **I**ncrement **A**fter, means to increment the address in register
4 to the address after the last address written by the instruction. The `!`
means we store the result of the instruction into register 4, rather than
discarding it. Overall, this block stores 16 bytes of zeroes into the address of
register 4, then increments that address. This loops until the address of
register 4 is greater than or equal to that of register 9, by which time the
entire BSS is zeroed. 

```assembly
ldr r3, =kernel_main
blx r3
```
Finally, we load the address of the function `kernel_main` into register 3, and
transfer execution to this (the address of the next instruction is stored in the
Link Register (r14), address of `kernel_main` is stored in PC).

Overall, this code initialises a minimum C environment, meaning we initialise
the stack and zero out the BSS segment before calling the `kernel_main`
function. We avoid using registers 0, 1, and 2 as they are used in the
`kernel_main` call to pass parameters and hardware information at runtime.

#### Note about freestanding vs. hosted environments
Typical programs are written to run in a hosted environment, meaning it has
access to the C standard library and other useful runtime features. By contrast,
in OS dev, we use a freestanding environment (as we must create our own standard
library to run on our operating system), meaning there is no C standard library,
and may only use what we supply ourselves. Some header files are not part of the
C standard library, but rather the compiler, meaning they are available in a
freestanding environment such as this. In particular, headers available (minus a
few special purpose ones from GCC) are: `<stddef.h>` `<stdint.h>`, `<float.h>`,
`<limits.h>`, `<stdarg.h>`, and`<iso646.h>`. Note that these only supply us with
some macros, and we still have to define all function we wish to use ourselves.

### uart.c
This sets up the hardware for basic I/O. For now, this is done using UART
(Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter), meaning text data is sent and
received through serial ports. To do this in the final version requires a
USB-to-TTL cable, but we can emulate this using the virtual machine for now. In
this we use Memory Mapped I/O - the process of performing I/O by reading from
and writing to predefined memory addresses. 

A peripheral is a device with a specific address from and to which it may read
and write data. All peripherals may be described by an offset from the
Peripheral Base Address, which begins at address 0x3f000000 on the Raspberry Pi
2.

A register is a 32-bit chunk of memory that a peripheral may read from or write
to: these are at predefined offsets from the base address. A full list of all
UART registers on the BCM2835/6 chip can be found on page 177 of the BCM2835 ARM
Peripherals Manual. This also gives the UART base address of 0x7e201000, however
on the Raspberry Pi 2, this is at 0x3f201000 instead. **N.B.** From the manual:
"Physical addresses range from 0x20000000 to 0x20ffffff for peripherals. The
bus addresses for peripherals are set up to map onto the peripheral bus address
range starting at 0x7e000000. Thus a peripheral listed at 0x7ennnnnn will be
available at physical address 0x20nnnnnn."

`mmio_write()` takes a 32-bit register and stores the 32-bit data into the
register specified, while `mmio_read()` returns the data stored in that
register. The `delay()` function is used as a means of giving the hardware time
to respond to any writes we make.

`uart_init()` sets up the UART hardware for use, by setting some configuration
flags.

* `mmio_write(UART0_CR, 0x00000000)` disables all aspects of the UART hardware
(the Control Register)
* `mmio_write(GPPUD, 0x00000000)` disables all GPIO pins
* `mmio_write(GPPUDCLK0, (1 << 14) | (1 << 15))` marks pins 14 and 15 for
disabling, and `mmio_write(GPPUDCLK0, 0x00000000)` makes our changes take
effect.
* `mmio_write(UART0_ICR, 0x7ff)` sets all flags in the Interrupt Clear Register,
clearing all pending interrupts.
* `mmio_write(UART0_IBRD, 1)` and `mmio_write(UART0_FBRD, 40)` set up the baud
rate of the connection, i.e. the bits that may be transmitted across the serial
port per second. To set this, we must calculate the baud rate divisor, using
IBRD = UART clock speed / (16 * desired baud rate) (page 183). UART clock
speed = 3 MHz, desired baud rate = 115200. Since this formula does likely not
yield a whole number, we then use FBRD = (fractional part * 64) + 0.5
* `mmio_write(UART0_LCRH, (1 << 4) | (1 << 5) | (1 << 6))` sets bits 4, 5, and 6
of the Line Control Register. This enables FIFOs, and sets the word length (the
number of data bits to be transmitted and received in a frame) to 8 bits, from
page 184 of the Peripherals Manual.  `mmio_write(UART0_IMSC, (1 << 1) | (1 << 4)
| (1 << 5) | (1 << 6) | (1 << 7) | (1 << 8) | (1 << 9) | (1 << 10))` - disables
all interrupts by writing to the relevant bits in the Interrupt Mask Set Clear
register.
* `mmio_write(UART0_CR, (1 << 0) | (1 << 8) | (1 << 9))` enables UART hardware,
as well as the ability to receive (bit 8) and transmit (bit 9) data.

`uart_putc()` waits until the FIFO is no longer full (which we can tell by
looking at bit 5 of the Flags register, FR), and then writes `c` to the Data
Register, DR. `uart_getc()` waits until the FIFO is no longer empty, then
returns whatever is in the Data Register. `uart_puts()` just incorporates a loop
so that we may output whole strings at a time.

### kernel.c
Control is transferred to here from boot.s by the line `ldr r3, =kernel_main`.
All this does is initialises the UART, prints a welcome string, and waits to
receive and print some text from the keyboard. Notice the parameters for
`kernel_main`: the convention in ARM is to pass the first three parameters of a
function through registers 0, 1, and 2. The bootloader passes arguments to the
kernel via registers 0, 1, and 2, and boot.s makes sure to preserve these
registers (no line of code touches them). Register 0 contains a code for the
device from which the Raspberry Pi was booted (usually 0, but dependent on the
board firmware). Register 1 contains the 'ARM Linux Machine Type', which for the
Raspberry Pi 2 is 0x12dc, identifying the BCM2835 CPU (found [here]
(http://www.arm.linux.org.uk/developer/machines/)). When the bootloader loads
the kernel, it also passes some information about the hardware in order to run
it, called 'atags'. A pointer to this information is passed in register 2 just
before boot.s runs. Since register 2 contains the atags pointer, the third
argument to `kernel_main` is the atags pointer.

### linker.ld
To create the full kernel we must link all compiled object files into one final
program. For user-space programs, there are default scripts which do this, but
we have to create one ourselves for our kernel.

C program sections:
* `.text` - executable code
* `.rodata` - read-only data (global constants)
* `.data` - global variables initialised at compile-time
* `.bss` - uninitialised gloabal variables

**N.B:** In linker scripts, `.` stands for current address.

```assembly
ENTRY(_start)
```
This declares that the symbol `_start` from boot.s as the entry point of our
program.

Next we set symbols `__start` and `__text_start` to be 0x8000, which is where
the bootloader will put our kernel image. We then declare the `.text` section to
start directly after this. The code from boot.s is located in the first part of
this section, `.text.boot`. `KEEP` tells the linker to not try to optimise the
code in `.text.boot`. The second part of the `.text` section is all `.text`
sections from other objects, in any order.

Next, `ALIGN` is used to set the current address to the next available page (the
next largest address divisible by our page size, 4096). Then in much the same
way we declare the `.rodata`, `.data`, and `.bss` sections.

### Makefile
Only a few things to note. `CC = arm-none-eabi-gcc` uses the ARM cross-compiler
(I installed it from Arch Linux's package manager, pacman). Since we are
cross-compiling, we specify our target CPU, namely `cortex-a7` for the Raspberry
Pi 2.

* `-fpic` - generate position inedependent code, for use in a shared library
* `-ffreestanding` - compile for freestanding, as opposed to hosted, environment

For now, we use the target `run` to emulate the Raspberry Pi 2 on QEMU.

## Memory
Throughout the running of the operating system, processes and computations will
need to use memory. Since we are the kernel, we can use whatever memory we like.
To stop this all blowing up in our face, however, we organise memory into
equal-sized blocks called pages - these allow us to allocate blocks of memory
that are not insignificantly small, but not so large that they take up a
significant portion of memory.

### atags
In order to organise our memory, we need to know how much is available to us.
This can be done using atags
([reference](http://www.simtec.co.uk/products/SWLINUX/files/booting_article.html#appendix_tag_reference)).

We match the layout of the atags by defining some types (none, core, mem, ...,
cmdline). Then we iterate over the atag list until we reach the `MEM` tag, in
`get_mem_size()`.

## Paging
Number of pages is total memory (from atags) divided by page size, which is 4kB.
Pages need metadata: the virtual address they map to, flags for if it is
allocated, if it is a kernel page, and reserved for when we enable virtual
memory.

To hold all of the metadata, we use a large portion of memory just after the
kernel image for an array of pages/metadata. This address (just after the kernel
img) is found using the `__end` symbol, as declared in the linker script. We
also create a linked list of pages to keep track of which are free.

### Allocating pages
To allocate a page, just find one which hasn't been allocated yet and return a
pointer to its memory. The memory of the page itself can be found by multiplying
the index in the page array by 4096.

To free a page, we get the index to free by dividing its address by 4096.

## Allocating memory on the heap
We can take memory directly after the page metadata and reserve it for the heap.
This amount to reserve is arbitrary: 1MB is large enough to be sufficient for
all dynamic memory needs, and small enough to not use a significant portion of
memory that user code may want.

### Implementing `kmalloc()`
Associate each allocation with a header, which will all form a linked list. It
includes the allocation size, and whether it is currently in use. To allocate,
we must find an allocaion that is at least the number of requested bytes and not
currently in use. If the allocation being inspected is large relative to the
request, we can split it up (i.e. if allocation is >= 2 times the header -
avoids having too many allocations that are half header, half data).

### Implementing `kfree()`
Need to mark free'd segments as unallocated, and merge adjacent free segments
into one big one (avoid internal fragmentation). We do this with a while loop,
incrementally increasing the `segment_size` of the free'd segment, effectively
mergin free segments to the right.

### Initialising the heap
We must reserve the pages we are going to use, put a header stating there is a
1MB unused allocation here, and assign the `heap_segment_list_head` to this
header. Finally, this must actually be initialised by calling `mem_init()` in
`kernel_main()`.

## Printing to a real screen
### Framebuffers
Framebuffer - a piece of memory that is shared between CPU and GPU. CPU writes
RGB pixels to the framebuffer, and GPU renders it to the output device
(whichever one is connected).

Depth of a framebuffer - number of bits in every pixel e.g. 1 byte for each
red, green, and blue value (0-255) means depth of 24.

Pitch of a frambuffer - number of bytes in each row on the screen.

We can calculate pixels per row = pitch / (depth / 8).
Pixel located at (x,y) = pitch * y + (depth / 8) * x.

To draw anything to the screen, we need a framebuffer, which we request from the
GPU. We do this using the mailbox peripheral. 

### The mailbox peripheral
The mailbox is a peripheral that facilitates communication between the CPU and
the GPU. It starts at offset 0xB880.

The read register is at offset 0x00 from the mailbox base, and allows for
reading messages from the GPU. The lower 4 bits specify the channel the message
is from, and the upper 28 bits are data.

The status register is located at offset 0x18. Bit 30 signifies whether the read
register is empty, while bit 31 signifies whether the write register is full.

The write register is at offset 0x20.

A channel is a number specifying to you and the GPU what the information being
sent through the GPU means. For these purposes we will only need channel 1, the
Frambuffer channel, and channel 8, the property channel.

#### Reading from the mailbox
To read from the mailbox:
- read the status register to ensure the read register is not empty
- read the contents of the read register
- check the channel of the read message: either do something with the
  information, or discard
- if the channel is correct, read the data

#### Writing to the mailbox
- in a loop, check status register to ensure write register is not full
- write the data to the write register

### The property channel
The property channel, mailbox channel 8, is how to ask the GPU for a
framebuffer. It provides a means to get and set data about various hardware
devices, one of which is the framebuffer.

#### Property channel messages
A message must be 16-byte aligned buffer of 4-byte words. The respinse
overwrites the original message.

A message begins with a 4 byte size of the message, plus 4 bytes for the size
itself. This is followed by a 4 byte request/respnse code. When sending a
message, this must be 0. When receiving, it will be either 0x80000000
(indicating success) or 0x80000001 (indicating error).

Following the request/response code comes a list of tags - commands and buffers
for their (the commands') responses. The very last tag must be an end tag, which
is 4 bytes of 0. Finally, the entire message must be padded to ensure 16 byte
alignment.

#### Message tags
A tag is a command to get or set data about the hardware. Each starts with a 4
byte tag id, which identifies the command to be run. In general, tags are of the
form 0x000XYZZZ, where X specifies the hardware device to access, Y the type of
command (0 - get, 4 - test, 8 - set), and ZZZ is the specific command. A tag
also stores the size of its value buffer in bytes, i.e. the maximum of the size
of the parameters the command takes, and the size of the results. The tag also
has its own request/response code. Sending => 0, while receiving => value is
0x80000000 + the length of the result. After this is the value buffer, where the
parameters and results are stored.

#### Getting a framebuffer
First we must set the screen size, virtual screen size, and depth. The tag ids
for these commands are 0x00048003, 0x00048004, and 0x00048005 respectively. 

More information on framebuffers can be found
[here](https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/wiki/Mailboxes).

## Loading on real hardware
Using `arm-none-eabi-objcopy`, we copy the kernel ELF file to a raw binary file.
Then, we must copy this image to the SD card from which the operating system
will boot. An easy way to do this is to install an operating system with an already
functioning boot partition, and replace the `.img` file with that built by the
makefile one. In this
case I just used the official Raspbian download from the Raspberry Pi website.
Then you can mount the SD card with Raspbian, rename `kernel7.img` to something
else, and insert the custom `.img` file, so that this is loaded for execution
instead.

### The boot process on the Pi
The boot process relies on closed-source proprietary code programmed into the
SoC processor, which cannot be modifiedi. Importantly, the ARM CPU is not hte
main CPU - it is a coprocessor to the VideoCore GPU. Upon powerup, the ARM CPU
is halted and the GPU is run. The firmware then loads the bootloader from ROM to
the L2 cache and executes it.  This first stage bootloader mounts the FAT32 boot
partition on the SD card so that the second stage bootloader may be accessed.
This is its only responsibility, to load `bootcode.bin`. The first stage
bootloader is programmed into the SoC itself during manufacture and cannot be
reprogrammed by the user.  Next, the second stage bootloader (`bootcode.bin`)
then retrieves the GPU firmware from the SD card, programs the firmware, then
starts the GPU. The GPU firmware (`start.elf`) is loaded, and allows the GPU to
start up the CPU. An additional file `fixup.dat` is used to configure the SDRAM
partition between the GPU and CPU. Here the kernel image is loaded, the CPU is
released from reset, and control is transferred to it to execute the kernel.

After the operating system is loaded, the code on the GPU is not unloaded;
instead, it runs its own simple operating system, called Video Core Operating
System (VCOS). The kernel can then use this to communicate with the services it
provides (e.g. providing a framebuffer, as above) using the Mailbox Peripheral
and interrupts (the GPU is able to produce ARM interrupts). The GPU is not only
in charge of graphical functions - it also controls clocks and audio, for
example. In this way the GPU firmware is similarly to a normal PC's BIOS (Basic
Input/Output System).

## Debugging real hardware
On the first attempt, printing out on real hardware did not work, despite
functioning well in the emulated environment provided by QEMU. In particular,
the screen displayed the "rainbow screen". As there is no real platform to debug
software at such a low level, the approach I took was to flash the ACT LED in
two locations in the boot code - firstly before `kernel_main` is called, to
check the setup prior to this is functioning correctly, then after `kernel_main`
is called, to ensure the kernel is being called and executed correctly.

[here](https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/67431/cant-turn-on-act-led-on-baremetal-pi3)

The ACT LED is located on GPIO pin 47. This pin is pull-high, meaning we have to
set the pin to turn the LED on (on the Pi 1, the ACT LED was on pin 16, which
was pull-low, meaning it had to be cleared to be turned on). So we need to use
GPSET and GPCLR to turn the pin on and off respectively. But there are two
versions of each, namely GPSET0, GPSET1, GPCLR0, and GPCLR1. GPSET0 and GPCLR0
deal with register 0 to 31, so we need to use GPSET1 and GPCLR1.

Now the ACT blinks on and off at around a half second delay thanks to the
following assembly: TODO
